acknowlgements it has cons of data privacy and low bandwidth.
on datalink layer contains switch it sends data on particular destination. switch solves dataaprivacy as it uses mac address

Network layer:For commmunicating data outside the network.Router communicates one network with other network it uses IP address
IP is internet protocol it has five types class A, class B, class C, class D, class E it is represented in 4 objects as
w.x.y.z all having 8 bits having total size as 32 bits which is IPv4 version of IP.first object i.e w defines we are in which class
1-126 you are in class A
128-191 Class B
192-223 Class C
224-255 Class D&E(used for broadcasting)
for class A w=> nerwork Id, x,y,z=>Host Id having s^32-2 hosts
for class B w,x => Network Id, y,z =>Host Id it has 2^16-2 hosts
for class C w,x,y => Network Id, z=> Host Id it has 2^8-2(as 255 is used for broadcasting
