Lab5.
vacuum tube predecessor of transisitor it has any falws
first transistoe was allied fuse transistor
p type semiconductorwas germinuim in the beginning 
nowadays silicon planar transistorsa are used.
silicon from sand is melted and a cylinder of pure silicon is made and its parts are sliced.
0.1mm wafers(discs are cut from it) on them ics transistors are made.
SSI: the number of transistors in a segment is determined by its density.and density is
determined by ssi,msi,lsi,vlsi.
simple wafer it doped with n type silicon.
since it is too small it is constructed through picture lithography
tranisistors are made by chemical reactions.
Laser light is used for extraction of material to make a depth
stensil is used to focus laser light and is the basic trick behind the formation of transisitors
filling if the material is made by bombardment of atoms
a resistor that is changed on the basis of an external factor is called thermistor
they are o ftwo type ptc(positive temperature oefficients)
ntc(negative temperature coefficients)
