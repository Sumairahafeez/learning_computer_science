Water jug problem:
	X   Y
step1   4   0
step2   1   3
step3   1   0
step4   0   1
step5   4   1
step6   2   3
step1 in every problem is to determine start state and end state
for full state x+y>4 and y>0
when branch factor increases we use dfs as only that branch is used.space complexity decreases.
