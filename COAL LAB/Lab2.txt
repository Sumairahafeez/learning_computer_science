Registers:
EAX=>{Extended Accumulator X=name}
its size is 32 bits in x86 processor
for reducing wastage logically we halfed it from center named AX
its size is 16 bits it is the lower half of the register(0-15)
we divide AX further into two smaller parts AH and AL each of 8 bits
if we want to store smaller data we use AL or AH
these are major general purpose registers.
higher part ki division nhi hai AX sirf aik hai 
EBX={Base}
ECX={control}
EDX={Data}
ESI EDI EBP ESP {last two cannot be used for our common use it is used in stack work}
is main minimun 16 bits ki division hoti hai just...
immediate constants any value that comes directly in code without any proper variable{hard code constants}
call is used to invoke a procedure{function}
writeint ny sirf register main pari value dikhani hai jo register us sy pehlay likha ho ga usay use krain gy...
jab isay use krna ho ga toh poory ka poora eax apny liye occupy krna paray ga...
movzx command is used when two registers of different length are used
movzx=>{move zero extension}
if signed number is included movsx{signed exten10:14 AM 1/20/2025sion}
EFlags gives indication and access to each and every single bit it changes the behaviour of the CPU
it control the operation of CPU it reflects the outcome of some operations...
ZR = zero flag{1 when ans is 0, 0 when answer is else or 1}
baki manual main likha hua hai...
