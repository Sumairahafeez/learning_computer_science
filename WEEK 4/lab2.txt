Buffer can have only one input and only one outpiut and gives the same output as input. It shape is like not gate without the nod infront of it.
if the output is opposite of the input it is called inverter. A gate is a logical circuit that takes input
and covert it into output.A= A'.
we have total 7 basic gates.
A gate having two inputs and one output which is like multiplication and gives 1 output when both f its inouts are 1.
OR GATE Has plus operation and gives output 1 when either of its inputs are 1.
NAND GATE A COMBO OD NOT AND AND GATE.
NOR GATE A COMBO OF NOT AND OR GATE.
XOR GATE 
XNOR GATE
5V means 1 and 0 v means 0.
UNIVERSAL GATES.
